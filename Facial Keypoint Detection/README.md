# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview
In this project, through combining knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition.

## Project Instructions
The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks, only Notebooks 2 and 3 (and the models.py file) will be graded:

- Notebook 1 (Load and Visualize Data) : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

- Notebook 2 (Define Network Architecture) : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

- Notebook 3 (Facial Keypoint Detection) : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and Trained CNN

- Notebook 4 (Fun with Keypoints) : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses

- model.py : Building the Convolution Neural Network

- load_data.py : Loading and Preparing the Data (transforms, normalize, etc.)
